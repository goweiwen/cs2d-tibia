# Introduction

[CS2DTibia](http://www.unrealsoftware.de/files_show.php?file=1135) is an RPG-like mod for the game [CS2D](http://www.cs2d.com). Too many features, so I'll just name the few ones that make the script unique.

# Features

∗ NPC system, very similar to the one in Tibia. It allows buying and selling of items, quests and stuff.

∗ Monster system, featuring Pokemon. (I can't find pictures, so my friend recommended me a Pikachu, and I ended up with all my monsters being pokemons.) The attacking of monsters is very hacky, as I couldn't find a way to see if the player is attacking monsters. I ended up looping through all the monsters and using a bit of trigo to calculate if they are hitting them.

∗ Leveling & money system. Players can gain experience and money. The amout of money & experience you have is shown in the lower right hand corner of your screen.

∗ Items system. You can drop & collect items, drop & collect money. Trading was implemented, but removed. I might re-add it if I find the need to.

∗ Inventory & Equipment system. The system is simple, F2 to access your inventory and F3 to access equipment. Simple items like runes & food.

∗ Simple weather & time system. Just 24 hours a day, with the radar showing the clock & an item used to check time. (the clock can be seen in screenshots)

∗ House system. Based on Tibia's housing system, you can rent a house for some money, and the house will expire after 24 hours. You can also extend the duration of rent by paying extra.

∗ Saving system, based on U.S.G.N. id. Saves characters, map items, house information, current weather & time, etc.
